# Pricing for South Shore Health in South East Massachusetts 

Displays Transparency Pricing from South Shore Health in a human readable format. 

## Caveats 

This is not a pricing calculator or estimator, and it is not finished. Insurance data isn't loaded yet, and I wrote this in the morning to make sense of bills about to be incurred. Shortcuts were taken, but the work was done so I wanted to share it. 

You must provide the JSON, with the latest one available at the URL: https://www.southshorehealth.org/patient-resources/billing-insurance/pricing-information

## Why?

South Shore Health provides the public with a "machine-readable JSON file". It may be an attempt to comply with the US Government's Hosptial Pricing Transparency laws, however, according to [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency), they are required to provide information as both:
> 1. As a comprehensive machine-readable file with all items and services.
> 2. In a display of shoppable services in a consumer-friendly format.

They also provide an estimate tool, but warn that because the prices change frequently, it may be inaccurate. The estimate tool is a link to contact them for an estimate. It is not a display of shoppable services. An estimate can take 2 weeks (I got one in a day), and is filled with language cautioning of price changes. 

The main hospital website provides a PDF with pricing, but this is not as complete, and the pricing information is likely an approximate.
